# Reflection - COMP 271 WEEK 07

This week I worked on finishing the add method for the HashTable class. At first I didn’t really understand how a hash table worked, but after reading the README and thinking about how the hashCode works, it started to click. The idea of using the hashCode to figure out which index to store something was kind of cool. I had to use Math.abs so I wouldn’t get a negative index. I also learned what to do when there’s already something in that spot — just link the new node to the old one and move it to the front of the list.
Compared to last week’s assignment with Stack and Queue, I think this one went a little smoother. I had some trouble with pushing in the Stack class before, but now I get how shifting things works and how to build new data structures by reusing what we already wrote. When I looked at the solution Leo posted for the Stack and Queue code, I saw that some of my methods could have been shorter or reused other methods better. That helped me write cleaner code this time.
I also started earlier on this assignment, which made it way less stressful. I didn’t feel like I was panicking to finish last minute. I want to keep doing that and maybe start even earlier next time. I think the hash table is one of the more interesting things we’ve done so far because it feels more like something you’d actually use in a real program. Overall, I feel like I’m getting better at understanding these data structures and writing the code for them.
